The NVIDIA GPU architecture is built around a scalable array of multithreaded _Streaming Multiprocessors_ (_SMs_). When a CUDA program on the host CPU invokes a kernel grid, the blocks of the grid are enumerated and distributed to multiprocessors with available execution capacity. The threads of a thread block execute concurrently on one multiprocessor, and multiple thread blocks can execute concurrently on one multiprocessor. As thread blocks terminate, new blocks are launched on the vacated multiprocessors.


A multiprocessor is designed to execute hundreds of threads concurrently. To manage such a large number of threads, it employs a unique architecture called _SIMT_ (_Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread_) that is described in [SIMT Architecture](#simt-architecture). The instructions are pipelined, leveraging instruction-level parallelism within a single thread, as well as extensive thread-level parallelism through simultaneous hardware multithreading as detailed in [Hardware Multithreading](#hardware-multithreading). Unlike CPU cores, they are issued in order and there is no branch prediction or speculative execution.


[SIMT Architecture](#simt-architecture) and [Hardware Multithreading](#hardware-multithreading) describe the architecture features of the streaming multiprocessor that are common to all devices. [Compute Capability 5.x](#compute-capability-5-x), [Compute Capability 6.x](#compute-capability-6-x), and [Compute Capability 7.x](#compute-capability-7-x) provide the specifics for devices of compute capabilities 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x respectively.


The NVIDIA GPU architecture uses a little-endian representation.


##  7.1. SIMT Architecture 

The multiprocessor creates, manages, schedules, and executes threads in groups of 32 parallel threads called _warps_. Individual threads composing a warp start together at the same program address, but they have their own instruction address counter and register state and are therefore free to branch and execute independently. The term _warp_ originates from weaving, the first parallel thread technology. A _half-warp_ is either the first or second half of a warp. A _quarter-warp_ is either the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of a warp.

When a multiprocessor is given one or more thread blocks to execute, it partitions them into warps and each warp gets scheduled by a _warp scheduler_ for execution. The way a block is partitioned into warps is always the same; each warp contains threads of consecutive, increasing thread IDs with the first warp containing thread 0. [Thread Hierarchy](#thread-hierarchy) describes how thread IDs relate to thread indices in the block.

A warp executes one common instruction at a time, so full efficiency is realized when all 32 threads of a warp agree on their execution path. If threads of a warp diverge via a data-dependent conditional branch, the warp executes each branch path taken, disabling threads that are not on that path. Branch divergence occurs only within a warp; different warps execute independently regardless of whether they are executing common or disjoint code paths.

The SIMT architecture is akin to SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector organizations in that a single instruction controls multiple processing elements. A key difference is that SIMD vector organizations expose the SIMD width to the software, whereas SIMT instructions specify the execution and branching behavior of a single thread. In contrast with SIMD vector machines, SIMT enables programmers to write thread-level parallel code for independent, scalar threads, as well as data-parallel code for coordinated threads. For the purposes of correctness, the programmer can essentially ignore the SIMT behavior; however, substantial performance improvements can be realized by taking care that the code seldom requires threads in a warp to diverge. In practice, this is analogous to the role of cache lines in traditional code: Cache line size can be safely ignored when designing for correctness but must be considered in the code structure when designing for peak performance. Vector architectures, on the other hand, require the software to coalesce loads into vectors and manage divergence manually.

Prior to NVIDIA Volta, warps used a single program counter shared amongst all 32 threads in the warp together with an active mask specifying the active threads of the warp. As a result, threads from the same warp in divergent regions or different states of execution cannot signal each other or exchange data, and algorithms requiring fine-grained sharing of data guarded by locks or mutexes can easily lead to deadlock, depending on which warp the contending threads come from.

Starting with the NVIDIA Volta architecture, _Independent Thread Scheduling_ allows full concurrency between threads, regardless of warp. With Independent Thread Scheduling, the GPU maintains execution state per thread, including a program counter and call stack, and can yield execution at a per-thread granularity, either to make better use of execution resources or to allow one thread to wait for data to be produced by another. A schedule optimizer determines how to group active threads from the same warp together into SIMT units. This retains the high throughput of SIMT execution as in prior NVIDIA GPUs, but with much more flexibility: threads can now diverge and reconverge at sub-warp granularity.

Independent Thread Scheduling can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity[2](#fn2) of previous hardware architectures. In particular, any warp-synchronous code (such as synchronization-free, intra-warp reductions) should be revisited to ensure compatibility with NVIDIA Volta and beyond. See [Compute Capability 7.x](#compute-capability-7-x) for further details.

Note

The threads of a warp that are participating in the current instruction are called the _active_ threads, whereas threads not on the current instruction are _inactive_ (disabled). Threads can be inactive for a variety of reasons including having exited earlier than other threads of their warp, having taken a different branch path than the branch path currently executed by the warp, or being the last threads of a block whose number of threads is not a multiple of the warp size.

If a non-atomic instruction executed by a warp writes to the same location in global or shared memory for more than one of the threads of the warp, the number of serialized writes that occur to that location varies depending on the compute capability of the device (see [Compute Capability 5.x](#compute-capability-5-x), [Compute Capability 6.x](#compute-capability-6-x), and [Compute Capability 7.x](#compute-capability-7-x)), and which thread performs the final write is undefined.

If an [atomic](#atomic-functions) instruction executed by a warp reads, modifies, and writes to the same location in global memory for more than one of the threads of the warp, each read/modify/write to that location occurs and they are all serialized, but the order in which they occur is undefined.


##  7.2. Hardware Multithreading 

The execution context (program counters, registers, and so on) for each warp processed by a multiprocessor is maintained on-chip during the entire lifetime of the warp. Therefore, switching from one execution context to another has no cost, and at every instruction issue time, a warp scheduler selects a warp that has threads ready to execute its next instruction (the [active threads](#simt-architecture-notes) of the warp) and issues the instruction to those threads.

In particular, each multiprocessor has a set of 32-bit registers that are partitioned among the warps, and a _parallel data cache_ or _shared memory_ that is partitioned among the thread blocks.

The number of blocks and warps that can reside and be processed together on the multiprocessor for a given kernel depends on the amount of registers and shared memory used by the kernel and the amount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor. There are also a maximum number of resident blocks and a maximum number of resident warps per multiprocessor. These limits as well the amount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor are a function of the compute capability of the device and are given in [Compute Capabilities](#compute-capabilities). If there are not enough registers or shared memory available per multiprocessor to process at least one block, the kernel will fail to launch.

The total number of warps in a block is as follows:

\\(\text{ceil}\left( \frac{T}{W_{size}},1 \right)\\)

  * _T_ is the number of threads per block,

  * _Wsize_ is the warp size, which is equal to 32,

  * ceil(x, y) is equal to x rounded up to the nearest multiple of y.


The total number of registers and total amount of shared memory allocated for a block are documented in the CUDA Occupancy Calculator provided in the CUDA Toolkit.

The term _warp-synchronous_ refers to code that implicitly assumes threads in the same warp are synchronized at every instruction.
