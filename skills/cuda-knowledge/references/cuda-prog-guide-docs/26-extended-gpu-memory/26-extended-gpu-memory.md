The Extended GPU Memory (EGM) feature, utilizing the high-bandwidth NVLink-C2C, facilitates efficient access to all system memory by GPUs, in a single-node system. EGM applies to integrated CPU-GPU NVIDIA systems by allowing physical memory allocation that can be accessed from any GPU thread within the setup. EGM ensures that all GPUs can access its resources at the speed of either GPU-GPU NVLink or NVLink-C2C.

In this setup, memory accesses occur via the local high-bandwidth NVLink-C2C. For remote memory accesses, GPU NVLink and, in some cases, NVLink-C2C are used. With EGM, GPU threads gain the capability to access all available memory resources, including CPU attached memory and HBM3, over the NVSwitch fabric.


##  26.1. Preliminaries 

Before diving into API changes for EGM functionalities, we are going to cover currently supported topologies, identifier assignment, prerequisites for virtual memory management, and CUDA types for EGM.

###  26.1.1. EGM Platforms: System topology 

Currently, EGM can be enabled in three platforms: **(1) Single-Node, Single-GPU** : Consists of an Arm-based CPU, CPU attached memory, and a GPU. Between the CPU and the GPU there is a high bandwidth C2C (Chip-to-Chip) interconnect. **(2) Single-Node, Multi-GPU** : Consists of fully connected four single-node, single-GPU platforms. **(3) Multi-Node, Single-GPU** : Two or more single-node multi-socket systems.

Note

Using `cgroups` to limit available devices will block routing over EGM and cause performance issues. Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` instead.

###  26.1.2. Socket Identifiers: What are they? How to access them? 

NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a memory architecture used in multi-processor computer systems such that the memory is divided into multiple nodes. Each node has its own processors and memory. In such a system, NUMA divides the system into nodes and assigns a unique identifier (numaID) to every node.

EGM uses the NUMA node identifier which is assigned by the operating system. Note that, this identifier is different from the ordinal of a device and it is associated with the closest host node. In addition to the existing methods, the user can obtain the identifier of the host node (numaID) by calling [cuDeviceGetAttribute](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__DEVICE.html#group__CUDA__DEVICE_1g9c3e1414f0ad901d3278a4d6645fc266) with `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID` attribute type as follows:
    
    
    int numaId;
    cuDeviceGetAttribute(&numaId, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID, deviceOrdinal);
    

###  26.1.3. Allocators and EGM support 

Mapping system memory as EGM does not cause any performance issues. In fact, accessing a remote socket’s system memory mapped as EGM is going to be faster. Because, with EGM traffic is guaranteed to be routed over NVLinks. Currently, `cuMemCreate` and `cudaMemPoolCreate` allocators are supported with appropriate location type and NUMA identifiers.

###  26.1.4. Memory management extensions to current APIs 

Currently, EGM memory can be mapped with Virtual Memory (`cuMemCreate`) or Stream Ordered Memory (`cudaMemPoolCreate`) allocators. The user is responsible for allocating physical memory and mapping it to a virtual memory address space on all sockets.

Note

Multi-node, single-GPU platforms require interprocess communication. Therefore we encourage the reader to see [Chapter 3](#interprocess-communication)

Note

We encourage readers to read CUDA Programming Guide’s [Chapter 10](#virtual-memory-management) and [Chapter 11](#stream-ordered-memory-allocator) for a better understanding.

New CUDA property types have been added to APIs for allowing those approaches to understand allocation locations using NUMA-like node identifiers:

**CUDA Type** | **Used with**  
---|---  
`CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA` | `CUmemAllocationProp` for `cuMemCreate`  
`cudaMemLocationTypeHostNuma` | `cudaMemPoolProps` for `cudaMemPoolCreate`

##  26.2. Using the EGM Interface 

###  26.2.1. Single-Node, Single-GPU 

Any of the existing CUDA host allocators as well as system allocated memory can be used to benefit from high-bandwidth C2C. To the user, local access is what a host allocation is today.

Note

Refer to the tuning guide for more information about memory allocators and page sizes.

###  26.2.2. Single-Node, Multi-GPU 

In a multi-GPU system, the user has to provide host information for the placement. As we mentioned, a natural way to express that information would be by using NUMA node IDs and EGM follows this approach. Therefore, using the `cuDeviceGetAttribute` function the user should be able to learn the closest NUMA node id. (See [Socket Identifiers: What are they? How to access them?](#socket-identifiers-what-are-they-how-to-access-them)). Then the user can allocate and manage EGM memory using VMM (Virtual Memory Management) API or CUDA Memory Pool.

####  26.2.2.1. Using VMM APIs 

The first step in memory allocation using Virtual Memory Management APIs is to create a physical memory chunk that will provide a backing for the allocation. See CUDA Programming Guide’s [Virtual Memory Management section](#virtual-memory-management) for more details. In EGM allocations the user has to explicitly provide `CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA` as the location type and numaID as the location identifier. Also in EGM, allocations must be aligned to appropriate granularity of the platform. The following code snippet shows allocating physical memory with `cuMemCreate`:
    
    
    CUmemAllocationProp prop{};
    prop.type = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_PINNED;
    prop.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA;
    prop.location.id = numaId;
    size_t granularity = 0;
    cuMemGetAllocationGranularity(&granularity, &prop, MEM_ALLOC_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM);
    size_t padded_size = ROUND_UP(size, granularity);
    CUmemGenericAllocationHandle allocHandle;
    cuMemCreate(&allocHandle, padded_size, &prop, 0);
    

After physical memory allocation, we have to reserve an address space and map it to a pointer. These procedures do not have EGM-specific changes:
    
    
    CUdeviceptr dptr;
    cuMemAddressReserve(&dptr, padded_size, 0, 0, 0);
    cuMemMap(dptr, padded_size, 0, allocHandle, 0);
    

Finally, the user has to explicitly protect mapped virtual address ranges. Otherwise access to the mapped space would result in a crash. Similar to the memory allocation, the user has to provide `CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA` as the location type and numaId as the location identifier. Following code snippet create an access descriptors for the host node and the GPU to give read and write access for the mapped memory to both of them:
    
    
    CUmemAccessDesc accessDesc[2]{{}};
    accessDesc[0].location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA;
    accessDesc[0].location.id = numaId;
    accessDesc[0].flags = CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READWRITE;
    accessDesc[1].location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;
    accessDesc[1].location.id = currentDev;
    accessDesc[1].flags = CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READWRITE;
    cuMemSetAccess(dptr, size, accessDesc, 2);
    

####  26.2.2.2. Using CUDA Memory Pool 

To define EGM, the user can create a memory pool on a node and give access to peers. In this case, the user has to explicitly define `cudaMemLocationTypeHostNuma` as the location type and numaId as the location identifier. The following code snippet shows creating a memory pool `cudaMemPoolCreate`:
    
    
    cudaSetDevice(homeDevice);
    cudaMemPoolProps props{};
    props.allocType = cudaMemAllocationTypePinned;
    props.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeHostNuma;
    props.location.id = numaId;
    cudaMemPoolCreate(&memPool, &props);
    

Additionally, for direct connect peer access, it is also possible to use the existing peer access API, `cudaMemPoolSetAccess`. An example for an accessingDevice is shown in the following code snippet:
    
    
    cudaMemAccessDesc desc{};
    desc.flags = cudaMemAccessFlagsProtReadWrite;
    desc.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;
    desc.location.id = accessingDevice;
    cudaMemPoolSetAccess(memPool, &desc, 1);
    

When the memory pool is created, and accesses are given, the user can set created memory pool to the residentDevice and start allocating memory using `cudaMallocAsync`:
    
    
    cudaDeviceSetMemPool(residentDevice, memPool);
    cudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, memPool, stream);
    

Note

EGM is mapped with 2MB pages. Therefore, users may encounter more TLB misses when accessing very large allocations.

###  26.2.3. Multi-Node, Single-GPU 

Beyond memory allocation, remote peer access does not have EGM-specific modification and it follows CUDA inter process (IPC) protocol. See [CUDA Programming Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html%23allocating-physical-memory&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1696873412606850&usg=AOvVaw0IF8bdtDWgRlAiW3tIoyXg) for more details in IPC.

The user should allocate memory using `cuMemCreate` and again the user has to explicitly provide `CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA` as the location type and numaID as the location identifier. In addition `CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_FABRIC` should be defined as the requested handle type. The following code snippet shows allocating physical memory on Node A:
    
    
    CUmemAllocationProp prop{};
    prop.type = CU_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_PINNED;
    prop.requestedHandleTypes = CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_FABRIC;
    prop.location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA;
    prop.location.id = numaId;
    size_t granularity = 0;
    cuMemGetAllocationGranularity(&granularity, &prop,
                                  MEM_ALLOC_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM);
    size_t padded_size = ROUND_UP(size, granularity);
    size_t page_size = ...;
    assert(padded_size % page_size == 0);
    CUmemGenericAllocationHandle allocHandle;
    cuMemCreate(&allocHandle, padded_size, &prop, 0);
    

After creating allocation handle using `cuMemCreate` the user can export that handle to the other node, Node B, calling `cuMemExportToShareableHandle`:
    
    
    cuMemExportToShareableHandle(&fabricHandle, allocHandle,
                                 CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_FABRIC, 0);
    // At this point, fabricHandle should be sent to Node B via TCP/IP.
    

On Node B, the handle can be imported using `cuMemImportFromShareableHandle` and treated as any other fabric handle
    
    
    // At this point, fabricHandle should be received from Node A via TCP/IP.
    CUmemGenericAllocationHandle allocHandle;
    cuMemImportFromShareableHandle(&allocHandle, &fabricHandle,
                                   CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_FABRIC);
    

When handle is imported at Node B, then the user can reserve an address space and map it locally in a regular fashion:
    
    
    size_t granularity = 0;
    cuMemGetAllocationGranularity(&granularity, &prop,
                                  MEM_ALLOC_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM);
    size_t padded_size = ROUND_UP(size, granularity);
    size_t page_size = ...;
    assert(padded_size % page_size == 0);
    CUdeviceptr dptr;
    cuMemAddressReserve(&dptr, padded_size, 0, 0, 0);
    cuMemMap(dptr, padded_size, 0, allocHandle, 0);
    

As the final step, the user should give appropriate accesses to each of the local GPUs at Node B. An example code snippet that gives read and write access to eight local GPUs:
    
    
    // Give all 8 local  GPUS access to exported EGM memory located on Node A.                                                               |
    CUmemAccessDesc accessDesc[8];
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
       accessDesc[i].location.type = CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE;
       accessDesc[i].location.id = i;
       accessDesc[i].flags = CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READWRITE;
    }
    cuMemSetAccess(dptr, size, accessDesc, 8);
