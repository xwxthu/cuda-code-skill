# 21. Driver API


Warning

This document has been replaced by a new [CUDA Programming Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide). The information in this document should be considered legacy, and this document is no longer being updated as of CUDA 13.0. Please refer to the [CUDA Programming Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide) for up-to-date information on CUDA.


This section assumes knowledge of the concepts described in [CUDA Runtime](#cuda-c-runtime).


The driver API is implemented in the `cuda` dynamic library (`cuda.dll` or `cuda.so`) which is copied on the system during the installation of the device driver. All its entry points are prefixed with cu.


It is a handle-based, imperative API: Most objects are referenced by opaque handles that may be specified to functions to manipulate the objects.


The objects available in the driver API are summarized in [Table 28](#driver-api-objects-available-in-cuda-driver-api).


Table 28 Objects Available in the CUDA Driver API Object | Handle | Description  
---|---|---  
Device | CUdevice | CUDA-enabled device  
Context | CUcontext | Roughly equivalent to a CPU process  
Module | CUmodule | Roughly equivalent to a dynamic library  
Function | CUfunction | Kernel  
Heap memory | CUdeviceptr | Pointer to device memory  
CUDA array | CUarray | Opaque container for one-dimensional or two-dimensional data on the device, readable via texture or surface references  
Texture object | CUtexref | Object that describes how to interpret texture memory data  
Surface reference | CUsurfref | Object that describes how to read or write CUDA arrays  
Stream | CUstream | Object that describes a CUDA stream  
Event | CUevent | Object that describes a CUDA event


The driver API must be initialized with `cuInit()` before any function from the driver API is called. A CUDA context must then be created that is attached to a specific device and made current to the calling host thread as detailed in [Context](#context).


Within a CUDA context, kernels are explicitly loaded as PTX or binary objects by the host code as described in [Module](#module). Kernels written in C++ must therefore be compiled separately into _PTX_ or binary objects. Kernels are launched using API entry points as described in [Kernel Execution](#kernel-execution).


Any application that wants to run on future device architectures must load _PTX_ , not binary code. This is because binary code is architecture-specific and therefore incompatible with future architectures, whereas _PTX_ code is compiled to binary code at load time by the device driver.


Here is the host code of the sample from [Kernels](#kernels) written using the driver API:


    int main()
    {
        int N = ...;
        size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
    
        // Allocate input vectors h_A and h_B in host memory
        float* h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
        float* h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
    
        // Initialize input vectors
        ...
    
        // Initialize
        cuInit(0);
    
        // Get number of devices supporting CUDA
        int deviceCount = 0;
        cuDeviceGetCount(&deviceCount);
        if (deviceCount == 0) {
            printf("There is no device supporting CUDA.\n");
            exit (0);
        }
    
        // Get handle for device 0
        CUdevice cuDevice;
        cuDeviceGet(&cuDevice, 0);
    
        // Create context
        CUcontext cuContext;
        cuCtxCreate(&cuContext, NULL, 0, cuDevice);
    
        // Create module from binary file
        CUmodule cuModule;
        cuModuleLoad(&cuModule, "VecAdd.ptx");
    
        // Allocate vectors in device memory
        CUdeviceptr d_A;
        cuMemAlloc(&d_A, size);
        CUdeviceptr d_B;
        cuMemAlloc(&d_B, size);
        CUdeviceptr d_C;
        cuMemAlloc(&d_C, size);
    
        // Copy vectors from host memory to device memory
        cuMemcpyHtoD(d_A, h_A, size);
        cuMemcpyHtoD(d_B, h_B, size);
    
        // Get function handle from module
        CUfunction vecAdd;
        cuModuleGetFunction(&vecAdd, cuModule, "VecAdd");
    
        // Invoke kernel
        int threadsPerBlock = 256;
        int blocksPerGrid =
                (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
        void* args[] = { &d_A, &d_B, &d_C, &N };
        cuLaunchKernel(vecAdd,
                       blocksPerGrid, 1, 1, threadsPerBlock, 1, 1,
                       0, 0, args, 0);
    
        ...
    }
    


Full code can be found in the `vectorAddDrv` CUDA sample.


##  21.1. Context   
  
A CUDA context is analogous to a CPU process. All resources and actions performed within the driver API are encapsulated inside a CUDA context, and the system automatically cleans up these resources when the context is destroyed. Besides objects such as modules and texture or surface references, each context has its own distinct address space. As a result, `CUdeviceptr` values from different contexts reference different memory locations.

A host thread may have only one device context current at a time. When a context is created with `cuCtxCreate()`, it is made current to the calling host thread. CUDA functions that operate in a context (most functions that do not involve device enumeration or context management) will return `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT` if a valid context is not current to the thread.

Each host thread has a stack of current contexts. `cuCtxCreate()` pushes the new context onto the top of the stack. `cuCtxPopCurrent()` may be called to detach the context from the host thread. The context is then “floating” and may be pushed as the current context for any host thread. `cuCtxPopCurrent()` also restores the previous current context, if any.

A usage count is also maintained for each context. `cuCtxCreate()` creates a context with a usage count of 1. `cuCtxAttach()` increments the usage count and `cuCtxDetach()` decrements it. A context is destroyed when the usage count goes to 0 when calling `cuCtxDetach()` or `cuCtxDestroy()`.

The driver API is interoperable with the runtime and it is possible to access the _primary context_ (see [Initialization](#initialization)) managed by the runtime from the driver API via `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain()`.

Usage count facilitates interoperability between third party authored code operating in the same context. For example, if three libraries are loaded to use the same context, each library would call `cuCtxAttach()` to increment the usage count and `cuCtxDetach()` to decrement the usage count when the library is done using the context. For most libraries, it is expected that the application will have created a context before loading or initializing the library; that way, the application can create the context using its own heuristics, and the library simply operates on the context handed to it. Libraries that wish to create their own contexts - unbeknownst to their API clients who may or may not have created contexts of their own - would use `cuCtxPushCurrent()` and `cuCtxPopCurrent()` as illustrated in the following figure.

##  21.2. Module 

Modules are dynamically loadable packages of device code and data, akin to DLLs in Windows, that are output by nvcc (see [Compilation with NVCC](#compilation-with-nvcc)). The names for all symbols, including functions, global variables, and texture or surface references, are maintained at module scope so that modules written by independent third parties may interoperate in the same CUDA context.

This code sample loads a module and retrieves a handle to some kernel:
    
    
    CUmodule cuModule;
    cuModuleLoad(&cuModule, "myModule.ptx");
    CUfunction myKernel;
    cuModuleGetFunction(&myKernel, cuModule, "MyKernel");
    

This code sample compiles and loads a new module from PTX code and parses compilation errors:
    
    
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 8192
    CUmodule cuModule;
    CUjit_option options[3];
    void* values[3];
    char* PTXCode = "some PTX code";
    char error_log[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int err;
    options[0] = CU_JIT_ERROR_LOG_BUFFER;
    values[0]  = (void*)error_log;
    options[1] = CU_JIT_ERROR_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES;
    values[1]  = (void*)BUFFER_SIZE;
    options[2] = CU_JIT_TARGET_FROM_CUCONTEXT;
    values[2]  = 0;
    err = cuModuleLoadDataEx(&cuModule, PTXCode, 3, options, values);
    if (err != CUDA_SUCCESS)
        printf("Link error:\n%s\n", error_log);
    

This code sample compiles, links, and loads a new module from multiple PTX codes and parses link and compilation errors:
    
    
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 8192
    CUmodule cuModule;
    CUjit_option options[6];
    void* values[6];
    float walltime;
    char error_log[BUFFER_SIZE], info_log[BUFFER_SIZE];
    char* PTXCode0 = "some PTX code";
    char* PTXCode1 = "some other PTX code";
    CUlinkState linkState;
    int err;
    void* cubin;
    size_t cubinSize;
    options[0] = CU_JIT_WALL_TIME;
    values[0] = (void*)&walltime;
    options[1] = CU_JIT_INFO_LOG_BUFFER;
    values[1] = (void*)info_log;
    options[2] = CU_JIT_INFO_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES;
    values[2] = (void*)BUFFER_SIZE;
    options[3] = CU_JIT_ERROR_LOG_BUFFER;
    values[3] = (void*)error_log;
    options[4] = CU_JIT_ERROR_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES;
    values[4] = (void*)BUFFER_SIZE;
    options[5] = CU_JIT_LOG_VERBOSE;
    values[5] = (void*)1;
    cuLinkCreate(6, options, values, &linkState);
    err = cuLinkAddData(linkState, CU_JIT_INPUT_PTX,
                        (void*)PTXCode0, strlen(PTXCode0) + 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    if (err != CUDA_SUCCESS)
        printf("Link error:\n%s\n", error_log);
    err = cuLinkAddData(linkState, CU_JIT_INPUT_PTX,
                        (void*)PTXCode1, strlen(PTXCode1) + 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    if (err != CUDA_SUCCESS)
        printf("Link error:\n%s\n", error_log);
    cuLinkComplete(linkState, &cubin, &cubinSize);
    printf("Link completed in %fms. Linker Output:\n%s\n", walltime, info_log);
    cuModuleLoadData(cuModule, cubin);
    cuLinkDestroy(linkState);
    

Full code can be found in the `ptxjit` CUDA sample.


##  21.3. Kernel Execution 

`cuLaunchKernel()` launches a kernel with a given execution configuration.

Parameters are passed either as an array of pointers (next to last parameter of `cuLaunchKernel()`) where the nth pointer corresponds to the nth parameter and points to a region of memory from which the parameter is copied, or as one of the extra options (last parameter of `cuLaunchKernel()`).

When parameters are passed as an extra option (the `CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER` option), they are passed as a pointer to a single buffer where parameters are assumed to be properly offset with respect to each other by matching the alignment requirement for each parameter type in device code.

Alignment requirements in device code for the built-in vector types are listed in [Table 7](#vector-types-alignment-requirements-in-device-code). For all other basic types, the alignment requirement in device code matches the alignment requirement in host code and can therefore be obtained using `__alignof()`. The only exception is when the host compiler aligns `double` and `long long` (and `long` on a 64-bit system) on a one-word boundary instead of a two-word boundary (for example, using `gcc`’s compilation flag `-mno-align-double`) since in device code these types are always aligned on a two-word boundary.

`CUdeviceptr` is an integer, but represents a pointer, so its alignment requirement is `__alignof(void*)`.

The following code sample uses a macro (`ALIGN_UP()`) to adjust the offset of each parameter to meet its alignment requirement and another macro (`ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER()`) to add each parameter to the parameter buffer passed to the `CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER` option.
    
    
    #define ALIGN_UP(offset, alignment) \
          (offset) = ((offset) + (alignment) - 1) & ~((alignment) - 1)
    
    char paramBuffer[1024];
    size_t paramBufferSize = 0;
    
    #define ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(value, alignment)                   \
        do {                                                        \
            paramBufferSize = ALIGN_UP(paramBufferSize, alignment); \
            memcpy(paramBuffer + paramBufferSize,                   \
                   &(value), sizeof(value));                        \
            paramBufferSize += sizeof(value);                       \
        } while (0)
    
    int i;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(i, __alignof(i));
    float4 f4;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f4, 16); // float4's alignment is 16
    char c;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(c, __alignof(c));
    float f;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f, __alignof(f));
    CUdeviceptr devPtr;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(devPtr, __alignof(devPtr));
    float2 f2;
    ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f2, 8); // float2's alignment is 8
    
    void* extra[] = {
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER, paramBuffer,
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_SIZE,    &paramBufferSize,
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END
    };
    cuLaunchKernel(cuFunction,
                   blockWidth, blockHeight, blockDepth,
                   gridWidth, gridHeight, gridDepth,
                   0, 0, 0, extra);
    

The alignment requirement of a structure is equal to the maximum of the alignment requirements of its fields. The alignment requirement of a structure that contains built-in vector types, `CUdeviceptr`, or non-aligned `double` and `long long`, might therefore differ between device code and host code. Such a structure might also be padded differently. The following structure, for example, is not padded at all in host code, but it is padded in device code with 12 bytes after field `f` since the alignment requirement for field `f4` is 16.
    
    
    typedef struct {
        float  f;
        float4 f4;
    } myStruct;
    


##  21.4. Interoperability between Runtime and Driver APIs 

An application can mix runtime API code with driver API code.

If a context is created and made current via the driver API, subsequent runtime calls will pick up this context instead of creating a new one.

If the runtime is initialized (implicitly as mentioned in [CUDA Runtime](#cuda-c-runtime)), `cuCtxGetCurrent()` can be used to retrieve the context created during initialization. This context can be used by subsequent driver API calls.

The implicitly created context from the runtime is called the _primary context_ (see [Initialization](#initialization)). It can be managed from the driver API with the [Primary Context Management](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__PRIMARY__CTX.html) functions.

Device memory can be allocated and freed using either API. `CUdeviceptr` can be cast to regular pointers and vice-versa:
    
    
    CUdeviceptr devPtr;
    float* d_data;
    
    // Allocation using driver API
    cuMemAlloc(&devPtr, size);
    d_data = (float*)devPtr;
    
    // Allocation using runtime API
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
    devPtr = (CUdeviceptr)d_data;
    

In particular, this means that applications written using the driver API can invoke libraries written using the runtime API (such as cuFFT, cuBLAS, …).

All functions from the device and version management sections of the reference manual can be used interchangeably.


##  21.5. Driver Entry Point Access 

###  21.5.1. Introduction 

The `Driver Entry Point Access APIs` provide a way to retrieve the address of a CUDA driver function. Starting from CUDA 11.3, users can call into available CUDA driver APIs using function pointers obtained from these APIs.

These APIs provide functionality similar to their counterparts, dlsym on POSIX platforms and GetProcAddress on Windows. The provided APIs will let users:

  * Retrieve the address of a driver function using the `CUDA Driver API.`

  * Retrieve the address of a driver function using the `CUDA Runtime API.`

  * Request _per-thread default stream_ version of a CUDA driver function. For more details, see [Retrieve Per-thread Default Stream Versions](#retrieve-per-thread-default-stream-versions).

  * Access new CUDA features on older toolkits but with a newer driver.


###  21.5.2. Driver Function Typedefs 

To help retrieve the CUDA Driver API entry points, the CUDA Toolkit provides access to headers containing the function pointer definitions for all CUDA driver APIs. These headers are installed with the CUDA Toolkit and are made available in the toolkit’s `include/` directory. The table below summarizes the header files containing the `typedefs` for each CUDA API header file.

Table 29 Typedefs header files for CUDA driver APIs API header file | API Typedef header file  
---|---  
`cuda.h` | `cudaTypedefs.h`  
`cudaGL.h` | `cudaGLTypedefs.h`  
`cudaProfiler.h` | `cudaProfilerTypedefs.h`  
`cudaVDPAU.h` | `cudaVDPAUTypedefs.h`  
`cudaEGL.h` | `cudaEGLTypedefs.h`  
`cudaD3D9.h` | `cudaD3D9Typedefs.h`  
`cudaD3D10.h` | `cudaD3D10Typedefs.h`  
`cudaD3D11.h` | `cudaD3D11Typedefs.h`  
  
The above headers do not define actual function pointers themselves; they define the typedefs for function pointers. For example, `cudaTypedefs.h` has the below typedefs for the driver API `cuMemAlloc`:
    
    
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020)(CUdeviceptr_v2 *dptr, size_t bytesize);
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000)(CUdeviceptr_v1 *dptr, unsigned int bytesize);
    

CUDA driver symbols have a version based naming scheme with a `_v*` extension in its name except for the first version. When the signature or the semantics of a specific CUDA driver API changes, we increment the version number of the corresponding driver symbol. In the case of the `cuMemAlloc` driver API, the first driver symbol name is `cuMemAlloc` and the next symbol name is `cuMemAlloc_v2`. The typedef for the first version which was introduced in CUDA 2.0 (2000) is `PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000`. The typedef for the next version which was introduced in CUDA 3.2 (3020) is `PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020`.

The `typedefs` can be used to more easily define a function pointer of the appropriate type in code:
    
    
    PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v2;
    PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v1;
    

###  21.5.3. Driver Function Retrieval 

Using the Driver Entry Point Access APIs and the appropriate typedef, we can get the function pointer to any CUDA driver API.

####  21.5.3.1. Using the Driver API 

The driver API requires CUDA version as an argument to get the ABI compatible version for the requested driver symbol. CUDA Driver APIs have a per-function ABI denoted with a `_v*` extension. For example, consider the versions of `cuStreamBeginCapture` and their corresponding `typedefs` from `cudaTypedefs.h`:
    
    
    // cuda.h
    CUresult CUDAAPI cuStreamBeginCapture(CUstream hStream);
    CUresult CUDAAPI cuStreamBeginCapture_v2(CUstream hStream, CUstreamCaptureMode mode);
    
    // cudaTypedefs.h
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10000)(CUstream hStream);
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10010)(CUstream hStream, CUstreamCaptureMode mode);
    

From the above `typedefs` in the code snippet, version suffixes `_v10000` and `_v10010` indicate that the above APIs were introduced in CUDA 10.0 and CUDA 10.1 respectively.
    
    
    #include <cudaTypedefs.h>
    
    // Declare the entry points for cuStreamBeginCapture
    PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10000 pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v1;
    PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture_v10010 pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v2;
    
    // Get the function pointer to the cuStreamBeginCapture driver symbol
    cuGetProcAddress("cuStreamBeginCapture", &pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v1, 10000, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);
    // Get the function pointer to the cuStreamBeginCapture_v2 driver symbol
    cuGetProcAddress("cuStreamBeginCapture", &pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_v2, 10010, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);
    

Referring to the code snippet above, to retrieve the address to the `_v1` version of the driver API `cuStreamBeginCapture`, the CUDA version argument should be exactly 10.0 (10000). Similarly, the CUDA version for retrieving the address to the `_v2` version of the API should be 10.1 (10010). Specifying a higher CUDA version for retrieving a specific version of a driver API might not always be portable. For example, using 11030 here would still return the `_v2` symbol, but if a hypothetical `_v3` version is released in CUDA 11.3, the `cuGetProcAddress` API would start returning the newer `_v3` symbol instead when paired with a CUDA 11.3 driver. Since the ABI and function signatures of the `_v2` and `_v3` symbols might differ, calling the `_v3` function using the `_v10010` typedef intended for the `_v2` symbol would exhibit undefined behavior.

Note that requesting a driver API with an invalid CUDA version will return an error `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_FOUND`. In the above code examples, passing in a version less than 10000 (CUDA 10.0) would be invalid.

####  21.5.3.2. Using the Runtime API 

The runtime API `cudaGetDriverEntryPointByVersion` uses the provided CUDA version to get the ABI compatible version for the requested driver symbol in the same way `cuGetProcAddress` does. In the below code snippet, the minimum CUDA version required would be CUDA 11.2 as `cuMemAllocAsync` was introduced then.
    
    
    #include <cudaTypedefs.h>
    
    int cudaVersion;
    // Ensure a CUDA driver >= 11.2 is installed or we will get an error from cuGetProcAddress
    status = cuDriverGetVersion(&cudaVersion);
    if (cudaVersion >= 11020) {
    
       // Declare the entry point
       PFN_cuMemAllocAsync_v11020 pfn_cuMemAllocAsync;
    
       // Intialize the entry point
       cudaGetDriverEntryPointByVersion("cuMemAllocAsync", &pfn_cuMemAllocAsync, 11020, cudaEnableDefault, &driverStatus);
    
       // Call the entry point
       if(driverStatus == cudaDriverEntryPointSuccess && pfn_cuMemAllocAsync) {
           pfn_cuMemAllocAsync(...);
       }
    }
    

####  21.5.3.3. Retrieve Per-thread Default Stream Versions 

Some CUDA driver APIs can be configured to have _default stream_ or _per-thread default stream_ semantics. Driver APIs having _per-thread default stream_ semantics are suffixed with __ptsz_ or __ptds_ in their name. For example, `cuLaunchKernel` has a _per-thread default stream_ variant named `cuLaunchKernel_ptsz`. With the Driver Entry Point Access APIs, users can request for the _per-thread default stream_ version of the driver API `cuLaunchKernel` instead of the _default stream_ version. Configuring the CUDA driver APIs for _default stream_ or _per-thread default stream_ semantics affects the synchronization behavior. More details can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/stream-sync-behavior.html#stream-sync-behavior__default-stream).

The _default stream_ or _per-thread default stream_ versions of a driver API can be obtained by one of the following ways:

  * Use the compilation flag `--default-stream per-thread` or define the macro `CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM` to get _per-thread default stream_ behavior.

  * Force _default stream_ or _per-thread default stream_ behavior using the flags `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_LEGACY_STREAM/cudaEnableLegacyStream` or `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM/cudaEnablePerThreadDefaultStream` respectively.


####  21.5.3.4. Access New CUDA features 

It is always recommended to install the latest CUDA toolkit to access new CUDA driver features, but if for some reason, a user does not want to update or does not have access to the latest toolkit, the API can be used to access new CUDA features with only an updated CUDA driver. For discussion, let us assume the user is on CUDA 12.3 and wants to use a new driver API `cuFoo` available in the CUDA 12.5 driver. The below code snippet illustrates this use-case:
    
    
    int main()
    {
        // Manually define the prototype as cudaTypedefs.h in CUDA 12.3 does not have the cuFoo typedef
        typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuFoo_v12050)(...);
        PFN_cuFoo_v12050 pfn_cuFoo = NULL;
        CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;
        int cudaVersion;
    
        // Ensure a CUDA driver >= 12.5 is installed or we will get an error from cuGetProcAddress
        status = cuDriverGetVersion(&cudaVersion);
        if (cudaVersion >= 12050) {
            // Get the address for cuFoo API using cuGetProcAddress. Specify CUDA version as
            // 12050 since cuFoo was introduced then
            CUresult status = cuGetProcAddress("cuFoo", &pfn_cuFoo, 12050, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);
    
            if (status == CUDA_SUCCESS && pfn_cuFoo) {
                pfn_cuFoo(...);
            }
            else {
                printf("Cannot retrieve the address to cuFoo - driverStatus = %d\n", driverStatus);
                assert(0);
            }
        }
    
        // rest of code here
    }
    

In the next example, we discuss how to get a new version of an API released in a minor version of the CUDA Toolkit. Note that in the cuda.h header the version macro that would bump `cuDeviceGetUuid` to _v2 is not done until a major boundary. So during the 11.4+ releases the following example illustrates how to get the _v2 version.

Note in this case the original (not the _v2 version) typedef looks like:
    
    
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid_v9020)(CUuuid *uuid, CUdevice_v1 dev);
    

But the _v2 version typedef looks like:
    
    
    typedef CUresult (CUDAAPI *PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid_v11040)(CUuuid *uuid, CUdevice_v1 dev);
    
    
    
    #include <cudaTypedefs.h>
    
    CUuuid uuid;
    CUdevice dev;
    CUresult status;
    int cudaVersion;
    CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;
    
    status = cuDeviceGet(&dev, 0); // Get device 0
    // handle status
    
    status = cuDriverGetVersion(&cudaVersion);
    // handle status
    
    // Ensure a CUDA driver >= 11.4 is installed or we will get an error from cuGetProcAddress
    status = cuDriverGetVersion(&cudaVersion);
    if (cudaVersion >= 11040) {
       PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid_v11040 pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid;
       status = cuGetProcAddress("cuDeviceGetUuid", &pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid, 11040, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &driverStatus);
       if(CUDA_SUCCESS == status && pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid) {
          pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid(&uuid, dev);
       }
    }
    

###  21.5.4. Guidelines for cuGetProcAddress 

Below are guidelines to keep in mind when using `cuGetProcAddress`.

  * Code the CUDA version passed to `cuGetProcAddress` to match the typedef version (do not use a compile time constant such as `CUDA_VERSION` or a dynamic version such as returned from `cuDriverGetVersion`)

  * Check the current driver version (such as from `cuDriverGetVersion`) is sufficient before calling `cuGetProcAddress` or an error is expected or an unexpected symbol may be returned


####  21.5.4.1. Guidelines for Runtime API Usage 

Unless specified otherwise, the CUDA runtime API `cudaGetDriverEntryPointByVersion` will have similar guidelines as the driver entry point `cuGetProcAddress` since it allows for the user to request a specific CUDA driver version.

###  21.5.5. Determining cuGetProcAddress Failure Reasons 

There are two types of errors with cuGetProcAddress. Those are (1) API/usage errors and (2) inability to find the driver API requested. The first error type will return error codes from the API via the CUresult return value. Things like passing NULL as the `pfn` variable or passing invalid `flags`.

The second error type encodes in the `CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult *symbolStatus` and can be used to help distinguish potential issues with the driver not being able to find the symbol requested. Take the following example:
    
    
    // cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport was introduced in release CUDA 11.4
    #include <cuda.h>
    CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;
    cudaVersion = ...;
    status = cuGetProcAddress("cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport", &pfn, cudaVersion, 0, &driverStatus);
    if (CUDA_SUCCESS == status) {
        if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT == driverStatus) {
            printf("We can use the new feature when you upgrade cudaVersion to 11.4, but CUDA driver is good to go!\n");
            // Indicating cudaVersion was < 11.4 but run against a CUDA driver >= 11.4
        }
        else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND == driverStatus) {
            printf("Please update both CUDA driver and cudaVersion to at least 11.4 to use the new feature!\n");
            // Indicating driver is < 11.4 since string not found, doesn't matter what cudaVersion was
        }
        else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SUCCESS == driverStatus && pfn) {
            printf("You're using cudaVersion and CUDA driver >= 11.4, using new feature!\n");
            pfn();
        }
    }
    

The first case with the return code `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT` indicates that the `symbol` was found when searching in the CUDA driver but it was added later than the `cudaVersion` supplied. In the example, specifying `cudaVersion` as anything 11030 or less and when running against a CUDA driver >= CUDA 11.4 would give this result of `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT`. This is because `cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport` was added in CUDA 11.4 (11040).

The second case with the return code `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` indicates that the `symbol` was not found when searching in the CUDA driver. This can be due to a few reasons such as unsupported CUDA function due to older driver as well as just having a typo. In the latter, similar to the last example if the user had put `symbol` as CUDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport - notice the capital CU to start the string - `cuGetProcAddress` would not be able to find the API because the string doesn’t match. In the former case an example might be the user developing an application against a CUDA driver supporting the new API, and deploying the application against an older CUDA driver. Using the last example, if the developer developed against CUDA 11.4 or later but was deployed against a CUDA 11.3 driver, during their development they may have had a succesful `cuGetProcAddress`, but when deploying an application running against a CUDA 11.3 driver the call would no longer work with the `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` returned in `driverStatus`.
