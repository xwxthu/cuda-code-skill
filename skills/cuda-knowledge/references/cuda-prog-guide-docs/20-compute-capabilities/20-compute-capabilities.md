The general specifications and features of a compute device depend on its compute capability (see [Compute Capability](#compute-capability)).


[Table 26](#features-and-technical-specifications-feature-support-per-compute-capability) and [Table 27](#features-and-technical-specifications-technical-specifications-per-compute-capability) show the features and technical specifications associated with each compute capability that is currently supported.


Section [Floating-Point Standard](#floating-point-standard) reviews compliance with the IEEE floating-point standard.


Sections [Compute Capability 5.x](#compute-capability-5-x), [Compute Capability 6.x](#compute-capability-6-x), [Compute Capability 7.x](#compute-capability-7-x), [Compute Capability 8.x](#compute-capability-8-x), [Compute Capability 9.0](#compute-capability-9-0), [Compute Capability 10.0](#compute-capability-10-0), and [Compute Capability 12.0](#compute-capability-12-0) give more details on the architecture of devices with these respective compute capabilities.


##  20.1. Feature Availability 

Most compute features introduced with a compute architecture are intended to be available on all subsequent architectures. This is shown in [Table 26](#features-and-technical-specifications-feature-support-per-compute-capability) by the “yes” for availability of a feature on compute capabilities subsequent to its introduction.

###  20.1.1. Architecture-Specific Features 

Beginning with devices of Compute Capability 9.0, specialized compute features that are introduced with an architecture may not be guaranteed to be available on all subsequent compute capabilities. These features are called _architecture-specific_ features and target acceleration of specialized operations, such as Tensor Core operations, which are not intended for all classes of compute capabilities or may significantly change on future generations. Code must be compiled with an architecture-specific compiler target (see [Feature Set Compiler Targets](#feature-set-compiler-targets)) to enable architecture-specific features. Code compiled with an architecture-specific compiler target can only be run on the exact compute capability it was compiled for.

###  20.1.2. Family-Specific Features 

Beginning with devices of Compute Capability 10.0, some architecture-specific features are common to devices of more than one compute capability. The devices that contain these features are part of the same family and these features can also be called _family-specific_ features. Family-specific features are guaranteed to be available on all devices in the same family. A family-specific compiler target is required to enable family-specific features. See [Section 20.1.3](#feature-set-compiler-targets). Code compiled for a family-specific target can only be run on GPUs which are members of that family.

###  20.1.3. Feature Set Compiler Targets 

There are three sets of compute features which the compiler can target:

**Baseline Feature Set** : The predominant set of compute features that are introduced with the intent to be available for subsequent compute architectures. These features and their availability are summarized in [Table 26](#features-and-technical-specifications-feature-support-per-compute-capability).

**Architecture-Specific Feature Set** : A small and highly specialized set of features called architecture-specific, that are introduced to accelerate specialized operations, which are not guaranteed to be available or might change significantly on subsequent compute architectures. These features are summarized in the respective “Compute Capability #.#” subsections. The architecture-specific feature set is a superset of the family-specific feature set. Architecture-specific compiler targets were introduced with Compute Capability 9.0 devices and are selected by using an **a** suffix in the compilation target, for example by specifying `compute_100a` or `compute_120a` as the compute target.

**Family-Specific Feature Set** : Some architecture-specific features are common to GPUs of more than one compute capability. These features are summarized in the respective “Compute Capability #.#” subsections. With a few exceptions, later generation devices with the same major compute capability are in the same family. [Table 25](#family-specific-compatibility) indicates the compatibility of family-specific targets with device compute capability, including exceptions. The family-specific feature set is a superset of the baseline feature set. Family-specific compiler targets were introduced with Compute Capability 10.0 devices and are selected by using a **f** suffix in the compilation target, for example by specifying `compute_100f` or `compute_120f` as the compute target.

All devices starting from compute capability 9.0 have a set of features that are architecture-specific. To utilize the complete set of these features on a specific GPU, the architecture-specific compiler target with the suffix **a** must be used. Additionally, starting from compute capability 10.0, there are sets of features that appear in multiple devices with different minor compute capability. These sets of instructions are called family-specific features, and the devices which share these features are said to be part of the same family. The family-specific features are a subset of the architecture-specific features that are shared by all members of that GPU family. The family-specific compiler target with the suffix **f** allows the compiler to generate code which uses this common subset of architecture-specific features.

For example:

  * The `compute_100` compilation target does not allow use of architecture-specific features. This target will be compatible with all devices of compute capability 10.0 and later.

  * The `compute_100f` _family-specific_ compilation target allows the use of the subset of architecture-specific features that are common across the GPU family. This target will only be compatible with devices that are part of the GPU family. In this example it is compatible with devices of Compute Capability 10.0 and Compute Capability 10.3. The features available in the family-specific `compute_100f` target is a superset of the features available in the baseline `compute_100` target.

  * The `compute_100a` _architecture-specific_ compilation target allows use of the complete set of architecture-specific features in Compute Capability 10.0 devices. This target will only be compatible with devices of Compute Capability 10.0 and no others. The features available in the `compute_100a` target form a superset of the features available in the `compute_100f` target.


Table 25 Family-Specific Compatibility Compilation Target | Compatible with Compute Capability  
---|---  
`compute_100f` | 10.0 | 10.3  
`compute_103f` | 10.3 [26](#family2)  
`compute_110f` | 11.0 [26](#family2)  
`compute_120f` | 12.0 | 12.1  
`compute_121f` | 12.1 [26](#family2)  
  
26([1](#id395),[2](#id396),[3](#id397))
    

Some families only contain a single member when they are created. They may be expanded in the future to include more devices.

##  20.3. Floating-Point Standard   
  
All compute devices follow the IEEE 754-2008 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic with the following deviations:

  * There is no dynamically configurable rounding mode; however, most of the operations support multiple IEEE rounding modes, exposed via device intrinsics.

  * There is no mechanism for detecting that a floating-point exception has occurred and all operations behave as if the IEEE-754 exceptions are always masked, and deliver the masked response as defined by IEEE-754 if there is an exceptional event. For the same reason, while SNaN encodings are supported, they are not signaling and are handled as quiet.

  * The result of a single-precision floating-point operation involving one or more input NaNs is the quiet NaN of bit pattern 0x7fffffff.

  * Double-precision floating-point absolute value and negation are not compliant with IEEE-754 with respect to NaNs; these are passed through unchanged.


Code must be compiled with `-ftz=false`, `-prec-div=true`, and `-prec-sqrt=true` to ensure IEEE compliance (this is the default setting; see the `nvcc` user manual for description of these compilation flags).

Regardless of the setting of the compiler flag `-ftz`,

  * atomic single-precision floating-point adds on global memory always operate in flush-to-zero mode, i.e., behave equivalent to `FADD.F32.FTZ.RN`,

  * atomic single-precision floating-point adds on shared memory always operate with denormal support, i.e., behave equivalent to `FADD.F32.RN`.


In accordance to the IEEE-754R standard, if one of the input parameters to `fminf()`, `fmin()`, `fmaxf()`, or `fmax()` is NaN, but not the other, the result is the non-NaN parameter.

The conversion of a floating-point value to an integer value in the case where the floating-point value falls outside the range of the integer format is left undefined by IEEE-754. For compute devices, the behavior is to clamp to the end of the supported range. This is unlike the x86 architecture behavior.

The behavior of integer division by zero and integer overflow is left undefined by IEEE-754. For compute devices, there is no mechanism for detecting that such integer operation exceptions have occurred. Integer division by zero yields an unspecified, machine-specific value.

##  20.4. Compute Capability 5.x 

###  20.4.1. Architecture 

An SM consists of:

  * 128 CUDA cores for arithmetic operations (see [CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#arithmetic-instructions) for throughputs of arithmetic operations),

  * 32 special function units for single-precision floating-point transcendental functions,

  * 4 warp schedulers.


When an SM is given warps to execute, it first distributes them among the four schedulers. Then, at every instruction issue time, each scheduler issues one instruction for one of its assigned warps that is ready to execute, if any.

An SM has:

  * a read-only constant cache that is shared by all functional units and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which resides in device memory,

  * a unified L1/texture cache of 24 KB used to cache reads from global memory,

  * 64 KB of shared memory for devices of compute capability 5.0 or 96 KB of shared memory for devices of compute capability 5.2.


The unified L1/texture cache is also used by the texture unit that implements the various addressing modes and data filtering mentioned in [Texture and Surface Memory](#texture-and-surface-memory).

There is also an L2 cache shared by all SMs that is used to cache accesses to local or global memory, including temporary register spills. Applications may query the L2 cache size by checking the `l2CacheSize` device property (see [Device Enumeration](#device-enumeration)).

The cache behavior (e.g., whether reads are cached in both the unified L1/texture cache and L2 or in L2 only) can be partially configured on a per-access basis using modifiers to the load instruction.

###  20.4.2. Global Memory 

Global memory accesses are always cached in L2.

Data that is read-only for the entire lifetime of the kernel can also be cached in the unified L1/texture cache described in the previous section by reading it using the `__ldg()` function (see [Read-Only Data Cache Load Function](#ldg-function)). When the compiler detects that the read-only condition is satisfied for some data, it will use `__ldg()` to read it. The compiler might not always be able to detect that the read-only condition is satisfied for some data. Marking pointers used for loading such data with both the `const` and `__restrict__` qualifiers increases the likelihood that the compiler will detect the read-only condition.

Data that is not read-only for the entire lifetime of the kernel cannot be cached in the unified L1/texture cache for devices of compute capability 5.0. For devices of compute capability 5.2, it is, by default, not cached in the unified L1/texture cache, but caching may be enabled using the following mechanisms:

  * Perform the read using inline assembly with the appropriate modifier as described in the PTX reference manual;

  * Compile with the `-Xptxas -dlcm=ca` compilation flag, in which case all reads are cached, except reads that are performed using inline assembly with a modifier that disables caching;

  * Compile with the `-Xptxas -fscm=ca` compilation flag, in which case all reads are cached, including reads that are performed using inline assembly regardless of the modifier used.


When caching is enabled using one of the three mechanisms listed above, devices of compute capability 5.2 will cache global memory reads in the unified L1/texture cache for all kernel launches except for the kernel launches for which thread blocks consume too much of the SM’s register file. These exceptions are reported by the profiler.

###  20.4.3. Shared Memory 

Shared memory has 32 banks that are organized such that successive 32-bit words map to successive banks. Each bank has a bandwidth of 32 bits per clock cycle.

A shared memory request for a warp does not generate a bank conflict between two threads that access any address within the same 32-bit word (even though the two addresses fall in the same bank). In that case, for read accesses, the word is broadcast to the requesting threads and for write accesses, each address is written by only one of the threads (which thread performs the write is undefined).

[Figure 39](#shared-memory-5-x-examples-of-strided-shared-memory-accesses) shows some examples of strided access.

[Figure 40](#shared-memory-5-x-examples-of-irregular-shared-memory-accesses) shows some examples of memory read accesses that involve the broadcast mechanism.

##  20.5. Compute Capability 6.x 

###  20.5.1. Architecture 

An SM consists of:

  * 64 (compute capability 6.0) or 128 (6.1 and 6.2) CUDA cores for arithmetic operations,

  * 16 (6.0) or 32 (6.1 and 6.2) special function units for single-precision floating-point transcendental functions,

  * 2 (6.0) or 4 (6.1 and 6.2) warp schedulers.


When an SM is given warps to execute, it first distributes them among its schedulers. Then, at every instruction issue time, each scheduler issues one instruction for one of its assigned warps that is ready to execute, if any.

An SM has:

  * a read-only constant cache that is shared by all functional units and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which resides in device memory,

  * a unified L1/texture cache for reads from global memory of size 24 KB (6.0 and 6.2) or 48 KB (6.1),

  * a shared memory of size 64 KB (6.0 and 6.2) or 96 KB (6.1).


The unified L1/texture cache is also used by the texture unit that implements the various addressing modes and data filtering mentioned in [Texture and Surface Memory](#texture-and-surface-memory).

There is also an L2 cache shared by all SMs that is used to cache accesses to local or global memory, including temporary register spills. Applications may query the L2 cache size by checking the `l2CacheSize` device property (see [Device Enumeration](#device-enumeration)).

The cache behavior (for example, whether reads are cached in both the unified L1/texture cache and L2 or in L2 only) can be partially configured on a per-access basis using modifiers to the load instruction.

###  20.5.2. Global Memory 

Global memory behaves the same way as in devices of compute capability 5.x (See [Global Memory](#global-memory-5-x)).

###  20.5.3. Shared Memory 

Shared memory behaves the same way as in devices of compute capability 5.x (See [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-5-x)).


##  20.6. Compute Capability 7.x 

###  20.6.1. Architecture 

An SM consists of:

  * 64 FP32 cores for single-precision arithmetic operations,

  * 32 FP64 cores for double-precision arithmetic operations,[28](#fn35)

  * 64 INT32 cores for integer math,

  * 8 mixed-precision Tensor Cores for deep learning matrix arithmetic

  * 16 special function units for single-precision floating-point transcendental functions,

  * 4 warp schedulers.


An SM statically distributes its warps among its schedulers. Then, at every instruction issue time, each scheduler issues one instruction for one of its assigned warps that is ready to execute, if any.

An SM has:

  * a read-only constant cache that is shared by all functional units and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which resides in device memory,

  * a unified data cache and shared memory with a total size of 128 KB (_Volta_) or 96 KB (_Turing_).


Shared memory is partitioned out of unified data cache, and can be configured to various sizes (See [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-7-x).) The remaining data cache serves as an L1 cache and is also used by the texture unit that implements the various addressing and data filtering modes mentioned in [Texture and Surface Memory](#texture-and-surface-memory).

###  20.6.2. Independent Thread Scheduling 

The **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture** introduces _Independent Thread Scheduling_ among threads in a warp, enabling intra-warp synchronization patterns previously unavailable and simplifying code changes when porting CPU code. However, this can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity of previous hardware architectures.

Below are code patterns of concern and suggested corrective actions for Volta-safe code.

  1. For applications using warp intrinsics (`__shfl*`, `__any`, `__all`, `__ballot`), it is necessary that developers port their code to the new, safe, synchronizing counterpart, with the `*_sync` suffix. The new warp intrinsics take in a mask of threads that explicitly define which lanes (threads of a warp) must participate in the warp intrinsic. See [Warp Vote Functions](#warp-vote-functions) and [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions) for details.


Since the intrinsics are available with CUDA 9.0+, (if necessary) code can be executed conditionally with the following preprocessor macro:
    
    
    #if defined(CUDART_VERSION) && CUDART_VERSION >= 9000
    // *_sync intrinsic
    #endif
    

These intrinsics are available on all architectures, not just **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture** or **NVIDIA Turing GPU Architecture** , and in most cases a single code-base will suffice for all architectures. Note, however, that for _Pascal_ and earlier architectures, all threads in mask must execute the same warp intrinsic instruction in convergence, and the union of all values in mask must be equal to the warp’s active mask. The following code pattern is valid on **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture** , but not on _Pascal_ or earlier architectures.

> 
>     if (tid % warpSize < 16) {
>         ...
>         float swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16);
>         ...
>     } else {
>         ...
>         float swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16);
>         ...
>     }
>     

The replacement for `__ballot(1)` is `__activemask()`. Note that threads within a warp can diverge even within a single code path. As a result, `__activemask()` and `__ballot(1)` may return only a subset of the threads on the current code path. The following invalid code example sets bit `i` of `output` to 1 when `data[i]` is greater than `threshold`. `__activemask()` is used in an attempt to enable cases where `dataLen` is not a multiple of 32.

> 
>     // Sets bit in output[] to 1 if the correspond element in data[i]
>     // is greater than 'threshold', using 32 threads in a warp.
>     
>     for (int i = warpLane; i < dataLen; i += warpSize) {
>         unsigned active = __activemask();
>         unsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] > threshold);
>         if (warpLane == 0) {
>             output[i / 32] = bitPack;
>         }
>     }
>     

This code is invalid because CUDA does not guarantee that the warp will diverge ONLY at the loop condition. When divergence happens for other reasons, conflicting results will be computed for the same 32-bit output element by different subsets of threads in the warp. A correct code might use a non-divergent loop condition together with `__ballot_sync()` to safely enumerate the set of threads in the warp participating in the threshold calculation as follows.

> 
>     for (int i = warpLane; i - warpLane < dataLen; i += warpSize) {
>         unsigned active = __ballot_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, i < dataLen);
>         if (i < dataLen) {
>             unsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] > threshold);
>             if (warpLane == 0) {
>                 output[i / 32] = bitPack;
>             }
>         }
>     }
>     

[Discovery Pattern](#discovery-pattern-cg) demonstrates a valid use case for `__activemask()`.

  1. If applications have warp-synchronous codes, they will need to insert the new `__syncwarp()` warp-wide barrier synchronization instruction between any steps where data is exchanged between threads via global or shared memory. Assumptions that code is executed in lockstep or that reads/writes from separate threads are visible across a warp without synchronization are invalid.

             s_buff[tid] += temp;     __syncwarp();
         }
         
         if (tid == 0) {
             *output = s_buff[0] + s_buff[1];
         }
         __syncthreads();
         

  2. Although `__syncthreads()` has been consistently documented as synchronizing all threads in the thread block, _Pascal_ and prior architectures could only enforce synchronization at the warp level. In certain cases, this allowed a barrier to succeed without being executed by every thread as long as at least some thread in every warp reached the barrier. Starting with **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture** , the CUDA built-in `__syncthreads()` and PTX instruction `bar.sync` (and their derivatives) are enforced per thread and thus will not succeed until reached by all non-exited threads in the block. Code exploiting the previous behavior will likely deadlock and must be modified to ensure that all non-exited threads reach the barrier.


The `racecheck` and `synccheck` tools provided by `compute-saniter` can help with locating violations.

To aid migration while implementing the above-mentioned corrective actions, developers can opt-in to the Pascal scheduling model that does not support independent thread scheduling. See [Application Compatibility](#application-compatibility) for details.

###  20.6.3. Global Memory 

Global memory behaves the same way as in devices of compute capability 5.x (See [Global Memory](#global-memory-5-x)).

###  20.6.4. Shared Memory 

The amount of the unified data cache reserved for shared memory is configurable on a per kernel basis. For the _Volta_ architecture (compute capability 7.0), the unified data cache has a size of 128 KB, and the shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 96 KB. For the _Turing_ architecture (compute capability 7.5), the unified data cache has a size of 96 KB, and the shared memory capacity can be set to either 32 KB or 64 KB. Unlike Kepler, the driver automatically configures the shared memory capacity for each kernel to avoid shared memory occupancy bottlenecks while also allowing concurrent execution with already launched kernels where possible. In most cases, the driver’s default behavior should provide optimal performance.

Because the driver is not always aware of the full workload, it is sometimes useful for applications to provide additional hints regarding the desired shared memory configuration. For example, a kernel with little or no shared memory use may request a larger carveout in order to encourage concurrent execution with later kernels that require more shared memory. The new `cudaFuncSetAttribute()` API allows applications to set a preferred shared memory capacity, or `carveout`, as a percentage of the maximum supported shared memory capacity (96 KB for _Volta_ , and 64 KB for _Turing_).

`cudaFuncSetAttribute()` relaxes enforcement of the preferred shared capacity compared to the legacy `cudaFuncSetCacheConfig()` API introduced with Kepler. The legacy API treated shared memory capacities as hard requirements for kernel launch. As a result, interleaving kernels with different shared memory configurations would needlessly serialize launches behind shared memory reconfigurations. With the new API, the carveout is treated as a hint. The driver may choose a different configuration if required to execute the function or to avoid thrashing.
    
    
    // Device code
    __global__ void MyKernel(...)
    {
        __shared__ float buffer[BLOCK_DIM];
        ...
    }
    
    // Host code
    int carveout = 50; // prefer shared memory capacity 50% of maximum
    // Named Carveout Values:
    // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutDefault;   //  (-1)
    // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxL1;     //   (0)
    // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxShared; // (100)
    cudaFuncSetAttribute(MyKernel, cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout, carveout);
    MyKernel <<<gridDim, BLOCK_DIM>>>(...);
    

In addition to an integer percentage, several convenience enums are provided as listed in the code comments above. Where a chosen integer percentage does not map exactly to a supported capacity (SM 7.0 devices support shared capacities of 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 96 KB), the next larger capacity is used. For instance, in the example above, 50% of the 96 KB maximum is 48 KB, which is not a supported shared memory capacity. Thus, the preference is rounded up to 64 KB.

Compute capability 7.x devices allow a single thread block to address the full capacity of shared memory: 96 KB on _Volta_ , 64 KB on _Turing_. Kernels relying on shared memory allocations over 48 KB per block are architecture-specific, as such they must use dynamic shared memory (rather than statically sized arrays) and require an explicit opt-in using `cudaFuncSetAttribute()` as follows.
    
    
    // Device code
    __global__ void MyKernel(...)
    {
        extern __shared__ float buffer[];
        ...
    }
    
    // Host code
    int maxbytes = 98304; // 96 KB
    cudaFuncSetAttribute(MyKernel, cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, maxbytes);
    MyKernel <<<gridDim, blockDim, maxbytes>>>(...);
    

Otherwise, shared memory behaves the same way as for devices of compute capability 5.x (See [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-5-x)).


##  20.7. Compute Capability 8.x 

###  20.7.1. Architecture 

A Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) consists of:

  * 64 FP32 cores for single-precision arithmetic operations in devices of compute capability 8.0 and 128 FP32 cores in devices of compute capability 8.6, 8.7 and 8.9,

  * 32 FP64 cores for double-precision arithmetic operations in devices of compute capability 8.0 and 2 FP64 cores in devices of compute capability 8.6, 8.7 and 8.9

  * 64 INT32 cores for integer math,

  * 4 mixed-precision Third-Generation Tensor Cores supporting half-precision (fp16), `__nv_bfloat16`, `tf32`, sub-byte and double precision (fp64) matrix arithmetic for compute capabilities 8.0, 8.6 and 8.7 (see [Warp Matrix Functions](#wmma) for details),

  * 4 mixed-precision Fourth-Generation Tensor Cores supporting `fp8`, `fp16`, `__nv_bfloat16`, `tf32`, sub-byte and `fp64` for compute capability 8.9 (see [Warp Matrix Functions](#wmma) for details),

  * 16 special function units for single-precision floating-point transcendental functions,

  * 4 warp schedulers.


An SM statically distributes its warps among its schedulers. Then, at every instruction issue time, each scheduler issues one instruction for one of its assigned warps that is ready to execute, if any.

An SM has:

  * a read-only constant cache that is shared by all functional units and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which resides in device memory,

  * a unified data cache and shared memory with a total size of 192 KB for devices of compute capability 8.0 and 8.7 (1.5x _Volta_ ’s 128 KB capacity) and 128 KB for devices of compute capabilities 8.6 and 8.9.


Shared memory is partitioned out of the unified data cache, and can be configured to various sizes (see [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-8-x)). The remaining data cache serves as an L1 cache and is also used by the texture unit that implements the various addressing and data filtering modes mentioned in [Texture and Surface Memory](#texture-and-surface-memory).

###  20.7.2. Global Memory 

Global memory behaves the same way as for devices of compute capability 5.x (See [Global Memory](#global-memory-5-x)).

###  20.7.3. Shared Memory 

Similar to the [Volta architecture](#architecture-7-x), the amount of the unified data cache reserved for shared memory is configurable on a per kernel basis. For the **NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture** , the unified data cache has a size of 192 KB for devices of compute capability 8.0 and 8.7 and 128 KB for devices of compute capabilities 8.6 and 8.9. The shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 132 or 164 KB for devices of compute capability 8.0 and 8.7, and to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 100 KB for devices of compute capabilities 8.6 and 8.9.

An application can set the `carveout`, i.e., the preferred shared memory capacity, with the `cudaFuncSetAttribute()`.
    
    
    cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel_name, cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout, carveout);
    

The API can specify the carveout either as an integer percentage of the maximum supported shared memory capacity of 164 KB for devices of compute capability 8.0 and 8.7 and 100 KB for devices of compute capabilities 8.6 and 8.9 respectively, or as one of the following values: `{cudaSharedmemCarveoutDefault`, `cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxL1`, or `cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxShared`. When using a percentage, the carveout is rounded up to the nearest supported shared memory capacity. For example, for devices of compute capability 8.0, 50% will map to a 100 KB carveout instead of an 82 KB one. Setting the `cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout` is considered a hint by the driver; the driver may choose a different configuration, if needed.

Devices of compute capability 8.0 and 8.7 allow a single thread block to address up to 163 KB of shared memory, while devices of compute capabilities 8.6 and 8.9 allow up to 99 KB of shared memory. Kernels relying on shared memory allocations over 48 KB per block are architecture-specific, and must use dynamic shared memory rather than statically sized shared memory arrays. These kernels require an explicit opt-in by using `cudaFuncSetAttribute()` to set the `cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize`; see [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-7-x) for the **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture**.

Note that the maximum amount of shared memory per thread block is smaller than the maximum shared memory partition available per SM. The 1 KB of shared memory not made available to a thread block is reserved for system use.


##  20.8. Compute Capability 9.0 

###  20.8.1. Architecture 

A Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) consists of:

  * 128 FP32 cores for single-precision arithmetic operations,

  * 64 FP64 cores for double-precision arithmetic operations,

  * 64 INT32 cores for integer math,

  * 4 mixed-precision fourth-generation Tensor Cores supporting the new `FP8` input type in either `E4M3` or `E5M2` for exponent (E) and mantissa (M), half-precision (fp16), `__nv_bfloat16`, `tf32`, INT8 and double precision (fp64) matrix arithmetic (see [Warp Matrix Functions](#wmma) for details) with sparsity support,

  * 16 special function units for single-precision floating-point transcendental functions,

  * 4 warp schedulers.


An SM statically distributes its warps among its schedulers. Then, at every instruction issue time, each scheduler issues one instruction for one of its assigned warps that is ready to execute, if any.

An SM has:

  * a read-only constant cache that is shared by all functional units and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which resides in device memory,

  * a unified data cache and shared memory with a total size of 256 KB for devices of compute capability 9.0 (1.33x **NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture’s** 192 KB capacity).


Shared memory is partitioned out of the unified data cache, and can be configured to various sizes (see [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-9-0)). The remaining data cache serves as an L1 cache and is also used by the texture unit that implements the various addressing and data filtering modes mentioned in [Texture and Surface Memory](#texture-and-surface-memory).

For the _NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU architecture_ , the unified data cache has a size of 256 KB for devices of compute capability 9.0. The shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 132, 164, 196 or 228 KB.

As with the [NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture](#shared-memory-8-x), an application can configure its preferred shared memory capacity, i.e., the `carveout`. Devices of compute capability 9.0 allow a single thread block to address up to 227 KB of shared memory. Kernels relying on shared memory allocations over 48 KB per block are architecture-specific, and must use dynamic shared memory rather than statically sized shared memory arrays. These kernels require an explicit opt-in by using `cudaFuncSetAttribute()` to set the `cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize`; see [Shared Memory](#shared-memory-7-x) for the **NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture**.

Note that the maximum amount of shared memory per thread block is smaller than the maximum shared memory partition available per SM. The 1 KB of shared memory not made available to a thread block is reserved for system use.

The NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture includes features to accelerate matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) computations with:

  * asynchronous execution of MMA instructions

  * MMA instructions acting on large matrices spanning a warp-group
