# 6. Getting Started


There are several key strategies for parallelizing sequential code. While the details of how to apply these strategies to a particular application is a complex and problem-specific topic, the general themes listed here apply regardless of whether we are parallelizing code to run on for multicore CPUs or for use on CUDA GPUs.


##  6.1. Parallel Libraries 

The most straightforward approach to parallelizing an application is to leverage existing libraries that take advantage of parallel architectures on our behalf. The CUDA Toolkit includes a number of such libraries that have been fine-tuned for NVIDIA CUDA GPUs, such as `cuBLAS`, `cuFFT`, and so on.

The key here is that libraries are most useful when they match well with the needs of the application. Applications already using other BLAS libraries can often quite easily switch to `cuBLAS`, for example, whereas applications that do little to no linear algebra will have little use for `cuBLAS`. The same goes for other CUDA Toolkit libraries: `cuFFT` has an interface similar to that of `FFTW`, etc.

Also of note is the Thrust library, which is a parallel C++ template library similar to the C++ Standard Template Library. Thrust provides a rich collection of data parallel primitives such as scan, sort, and reduce, which can be composed together to implement complex algorithms with concise, readable source code. By describing your computation in terms of these high-level abstractions you provide Thrust with the freedom to select the most efficient implementation automatically. As a result, Thrust can be utilized in rapid prototyping of CUDA applications, where programmer productivity matters most, as well as in production, where robustness and absolute performance are crucial.


##  6.2. Parallelizing Compilers 

Another common approach to parallelization of sequential codes is to make use of parallelizing compilers. Often this means the use of directives-based approaches, where the programmer uses a pragma or other similar notation to provide hints to the compiler about where parallelism can be found without needing to modify or adapt the underlying code itself. By exposing parallelism to the compiler, directives allow the compiler to do the detailed work of mapping the computation onto the parallel architecture.

The OpenACC standard provides a set of compiler directives to specify loops and regions of code in standard C, C++ and Fortran that should be offloaded from a host CPU to an attached accelerator such as a CUDA GPU. The details of managing the accelerator device are handled implicitly by an OpenACC-enabled compiler and runtime.

See <http://www.openacc.org/> for details.


##  6.3. Coding to Expose Parallelism 

For applications that need additional functionality or performance beyond what existing parallel libraries or parallelizing compilers can provide, parallel programming languages such as CUDA C++ that integrate seamlessly with existing sequential code are essential.

Once we have located a hotspot in our application’s profile assessment and determined that custom code is the best approach, we can use CUDA C++ to expose the parallelism in that portion of our code as a CUDA kernel. We can then launch this kernel onto the GPU and retrieve the results without requiring major rewrites to the rest of our application.

This approach is most straightforward when the majority of the total running time of our application is spent in a few relatively isolated portions of the code. More difficult to parallelize are applications with a very flat profile - i.e., applications where the time spent is spread out relatively evenly across a wide portion of the code base. For the latter variety of application, some degree of code refactoring to expose the inherent parallelism in the application might be necessary, but keep in mind that this refactoring work will tend to benefit all future architectures, CPU and GPU alike, so it is well worth the effort should it become necessary.
