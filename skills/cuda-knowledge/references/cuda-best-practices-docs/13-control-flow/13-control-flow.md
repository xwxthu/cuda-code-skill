# 13. Control Flow


##  13.1. Branching and Divergence 

Note

**High Priority:** Avoid different execution paths within the same warp.

Flow control instructions (`if`, `switch`, `do`, `for`, `while`) can significantly affect the instruction throughput by causing threads of the same warp to diverge; that is, to follow different execution paths. If this happens, the different execution paths must be executed separately; this increases the total number of instructions executed for this warp.

To obtain best performance in cases where the control flow depends on the thread ID, the controlling condition should be written so as to minimize the number of divergent warps.

This is possible because the distribution of the warps across the block is deterministic as mentioned in SIMT Architecture of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide. A trivial example is when the controlling condition depends only on (`threadIdx` / `WSIZE`) where `WSIZE` is the warp size.

In this case, no warp diverges because the controlling condition is perfectly aligned with the warps.

For branches including just a few instructions, warp divergence generally results in marginal performance losses. For example, the compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Threads with a false predicate do not write results, and also do not evaluate addresses or read operands.

Starting with the Volta architecture, Independent Thread Scheduling allows a warp to remain diverged outside of the data-dependent conditional block. An explicit `__syncwarp()` can be used to guarantee that the warp has reconverged for subsequent instructions.


##  13.2. Branch Predication 

Note

**Low Priority:** Make it easy for the compiler to use branch predication in lieu of loops or control statements.

Sometimes, the compiler may unroll loops or optimize out `if` or `switch` statements by using branch predication instead. In these cases, no warp can ever diverge. The programmer can also control loop unrolling using
    
    
    #pragma unroll
    

For more information on this pragma, refer to the CUDA C++ Programming Guide.

When using branch predication, none of the instructions whose execution depends on the controlling condition is skipped. Instead, each such instruction is associated with a per-thread condition code or predicate that is set to true or false according to the controlling condition. Although each of these instructions is scheduled for execution, only the instructions with a true predicate are actually executed. Instructions with a false predicate do not write results, and they also do not evaluate addresses or read operands.

The compiler replaces a branch instruction with predicated instructions only if the number of instructions controlled by the branch condition is less than or equal to a certain threshold.
