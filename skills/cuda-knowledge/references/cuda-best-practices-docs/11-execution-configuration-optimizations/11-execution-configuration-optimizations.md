# 11. Execution Configuration Optimizations


One of the keys to good performance is to keep the multiprocessors on the device as busy as possible. A device in which work is poorly balanced across the multiprocessors will deliver suboptimal performance. Hence, it’s important to design your application to use threads and blocks in a way that maximizes hardware utilization and to limit practices that impede the free distribution of work. A key concept in this effort is occupancy, which is explained in the following sections.


Hardware utilization can also be improved in some cases by designing your application so that multiple, independent kernels can execute at the same time. Multiple kernels executing at the same time is known as concurrent kernel execution. Concurrent kernel execution is described below.


Another important concept is the management of system resources allocated for a particular task. How to manage this resource utilization is discussed in the final sections of this chapter.


##  11.1. Occupancy 

Thread instructions are executed sequentially in CUDA, and, as a result, executing other warps when one warp is paused or stalled is the only way to hide latencies and keep the hardware busy. Some metric related to the number of active warps on a multiprocessor is therefore important in determining how effectively the hardware is kept busy. This metric is _occupancy_.

Occupancy is the ratio of the number of active warps per multiprocessor to the maximum number of possible active warps. (To determine the latter number, see the `deviceQuery` CUDA Sample or refer to [Compute Capabilities](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities).) Another way to view occupancy is the percentage of the hardware’s ability to process warps that is actively in use.

Higher occupancy does not always equate to higher performance-there is a point above which additional occupancy does not improve performance. However, low occupancy always interferes with the ability to hide memory latency, resulting in performance degradation.

Per thread resources required by a CUDA kernel might limit the maximum block size in an unwanted way. In order to maintain forward compatibility to future hardware and toolkits and to ensure that at least one thread block can run on an SM, developers should include the single argument `__launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock)` which specifies the largest block size that the kernel will be launched with. Failure to do so could lead to “too many resources requested for launch” errors. Providing the two argument version of `__launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock,minBlocksPerMultiprocessor)` can improve performance in some cases. The right value for `minBlocksPerMultiprocessor` should be determined using a detailed per kernel analysis.

###  11.1.1. Calculating Occupancy 

One of several factors that determine occupancy is register availability. Register storage enables threads to keep local variables nearby for low-latency access. However, the set of registers (known as the _register file_) is a limited commodity that all threads resident on a multiprocessor must share. Registers are allocated to an entire block all at once. So, if each thread block uses many registers, the number of thread blocks that can be resident on a multiprocessor is reduced, thereby lowering the occupancy of the multiprocessor. The maximum number of registers per thread can be set manually at compilation time per-file using the `-maxrregcount` option or per-kernel using the `__launch_bounds__` qualifier (see [Register Pressure](#register-pressure)).

For purposes of calculating occupancy, the number of registers used by each thread is one of the key factors. For example, on devices of [CUDA Compute Capability](#cuda-compute-capability) 7.0 each multiprocessor has 65,536 32-bit registers and can have a maximum of 2048 simultaneous threads resident (64 warps x 32 threads per warp). This means that in one of these devices, for a multiprocessor to have 100% occupancy, each thread can use at most 32 registers. However, this approach of determining how register count affects occupancy does not take into account the register allocation granularity. For example, on a device of compute capability 7.0, a kernel with 128-thread blocks using 37 registers per thread results in an occupancy of 75% with 12 active 128-thread blocks per multi-processor, whereas a kernel with 320-thread blocks using the same 37 registers per thread results in an occupancy of 63% because only four 320-thread blocks can reside on a multiprocessor. Furthermore, register allocations are rounded up to the nearest 256 registers per warp.

The number of registers available, the maximum number of simultaneous threads resident on each multiprocessor, and the register allocation granularity vary over different compute capabilities. Because of these nuances in register allocation and the fact that a multiprocessor’s shared memory is also partitioned between resident thread blocks, the exact relationship between register usage and occupancy can be difficult to determine. The `--ptxas options=v` option of `nvcc` details the number of registers used per thread for each kernel. See Hardware Multithreading of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for the register allocation formulas for devices of various compute capabilities and Features and Technical Specifications of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for the total number of registers available on those devices. Alternatively, NVIDIA provides an occupancy calculator as part of Nsight Compute; refer to <https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightCompute/index.html#occupancy-calculator>.

An application can also use the Occupancy API from the CUDA Runtime, e.g. `cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor`, to dynamically select launch configurations based on runtime parameters.


##  11.2. Hiding Register Dependencies 

Note

**Medium Priority:** To hide latency arising from register dependencies, maintain sufficient numbers of active threads per multiprocessor (i.e., sufficient occupancy).

Register dependencies arise when an instruction uses a result stored in a register written by an instruction before it. The latency of most arithmetic instructions is typically 4 cycles on devices of compute capability 7.0. So threads must wait approximatly 4 cycles before using an arithmetic result. However, this latency can be completely hidden by the execution of threads in other warps. See [Registers](index.html#registers) for details.


##  11.3. Thread and Block Heuristics 

Note

**Medium Priority:** The number of threads per block should be a multiple of 32 threads, because this provides optimal computing efficiency and facilitates coalescing.

The dimension and size of blocks per grid and the dimension and size of threads per block are both important factors. The multidimensional aspect of these parameters allows easier mapping of multidimensional problems to CUDA and does not play a role in performance. As a result, this section discusses size but not dimension.

Latency hiding and occupancy depend on the number of active warps per multiprocessor, which is implicitly determined by the execution parameters along with resource (register and shared memory) constraints. Choosing execution parameters is a matter of striking a balance between latency hiding (occupancy) and resource utilization.

Choosing the execution configuration parameters should be done in tandem; however, there are certain heuristics that apply to each parameter individually. When choosing the first execution configuration parameter-the number of blocks per grid, or _grid size_ \- the primary concern is keeping the entire GPU busy. The number of blocks in a grid should be larger than the number of multiprocessors so that all multiprocessors have at least one block to execute. Furthermore, there should be multiple active blocks per multiprocessor so that blocks that aren’t waiting for a `__syncthreads()` can keep the hardware busy. This recommendation is subject to resource availability; therefore, it should be determined in the context of the second execution parameter - the number of threads per block, or _block size_ \- as well as shared memory usage. To scale to future devices, the number of blocks per kernel launch should be in the thousands.

When choosing the block size, it is important to remember that multiple concurrent blocks can reside on a multiprocessor, so occupancy is not determined by block size alone. In particular, a larger block size does not imply a higher occupancy.

As mentioned in [Occupancy](index.html#occupancy), higher occupancy does not always equate to better performance. For example, improving occupancy from 66 percent to 100 percent generally does not translate to a similar increase in performance. A lower occupancy kernel will have more registers available per thread than a higher occupancy kernel, which may result in less register spilling to local memory; in particular, with a high degree of exposed instruction-level parallelism (ILP) it is, in some cases, possible to fully cover latency with a low occupancy.

There are many such factors involved in selecting block size, and inevitably some experimentation is required. However, a few rules of thumb should be followed:

  * Threads per block should be a multiple of warp size to avoid wasting computation on under-populated warps and to facilitate coalescing.

  * A minimum of 64 threads per block should be used, and only if there are multiple concurrent blocks per multiprocessor.

  * Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation with different block sizes.

  * Use several smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call `__syncthreads()`.


Note that when a thread block allocates more registers than are available on a multiprocessor, the kernel launch fails, as it will when too much shared memory or too many threads are requested.


##  11.4. Effects of Shared Memory 

Shared memory can be helpful in several situations, such as helping to coalesce or eliminate redundant access to global memory. However, it also can act as a constraint on occupancy. In many cases, the amount of shared memory required by a kernel is related to the block size that was chosen, but the mapping of threads to shared memory elements does not need to be one-to-one. For example, it may be desirable to use a 64x64 element shared memory array in a kernel, but because the maximum number of threads per block is 1024, it is not possible to launch a kernel with 64x64 threads per block. In such cases, kernels with 32x32 or 64x16 threads can be launched with each thread processing four elements of the shared memory array. The approach of using a single thread to process multiple elements of a shared memory array can be beneficial even if limits such as threads per block are not an issue. This is because some operations common to each element can be performed by the thread once, amortizing the cost over the number of shared memory elements processed by the thread.

A useful technique to determine the sensitivity of performance to occupancy is through experimentation with the amount of dynamically allocated shared memory, as specified in the third parameter of the execution configuration. By simply increasing this parameter (without modifying the kernel), it is possible to effectively reduce the occupancy of the kernel and measure its effect on performance.


##  11.5. Concurrent Kernel Execution 

As described in [Asynchronous and Overlapping Transfers with Computation](index.html#asynchronous-transfers-and-overlapping-transfers-with-computation), CUDA streams can be used to overlap kernel execution with data transfers. On devices that are capable of concurrent kernel execution, streams can also be used to execute multiple kernels simultaneously to more fully take advantage of the device’s multiprocessors. Whether a device has this capability is indicated by the `concurrentKernels` field of the `cudaDeviceProp` structure (or listed in the output of the `deviceQuery` CUDA Sample). Non-default streams (streams other than stream 0) are required for concurrent execution because kernel calls that use the default stream begin only after all preceding calls on the device (in any stream) have completed, and no operation on the device (in any stream) commences until they are finished.

The following example illustrates the basic technique. Because `kernel1` and `kernel2` are executed in different, non-default streams, a capable device can execute the kernels at the same time.
    
    
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);
    kernel1<<<grid, block, 0, stream1>>>(data_1);
    kernel2<<<grid, block, 0, stream2>>>(data_2);
    


##  11.6. Multiple contexts 

CUDA work occurs within a process space for a particular GPU known as a _context_. The context encapsulates kernel launches and memory allocations for that GPU as well as supporting constructs such as the page tables. The context is explicit in the CUDA Driver API but is entirely implicit in the CUDA Runtime API, which creates and manages contexts automatically.

With the CUDA Driver API, a CUDA application process can potentially create more than one context for a given GPU. If multiple CUDA application processes access the same GPU concurrently, this almost always implies multiple contexts, since a context is tied to a particular host process unless [Multi-Process Service](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html) is in use.

While multiple contexts (and their associated resources such as global memory allocations) can be allocated concurrently on a given GPU, only one of these contexts can execute work at any given moment on that GPU; contexts sharing the same GPU are time-sliced. Creating additional contexts incurs memory overhead for per-context data and time overhead for context switching. Furthermore, the need for context switching can reduce utilization when work from several contexts could otherwise execute concurrently (see also [Concurrent Kernel Execution](index.html#concurrent-kernel-execution)).

Therefore, it is best to avoid multiple contexts per GPU within the same CUDA application. To assist with this, the CUDA Driver API provides methods to access and manage a special context on each GPU called the _primary context_. These are the same contexts used implicitly by the CUDA Runtime when there is not already a current context for a thread.
    
    
    // When initializing the program/library
    CUcontext ctx;
    cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain(&ctx, dev);
    
    // When the program/library launches work
    cuCtxPushCurrent(ctx);
    kernel<<<...>>>(...);
    cuCtxPopCurrent(&ctx);
    
    // When the program/library is finished with the context
    cuDevicePrimaryCtxRelease(dev);
    

Note

NVIDIA-SMI can be used to configure a GPU for [exclusive process mode](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-modes), which limits the number of contexts per GPU to one. This context can be current to as many threads as desired within the creating process, and `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain` will fail if a non-primary context that was created with the CUDA driver API already exists on the device.
