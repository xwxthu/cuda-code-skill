# 5. Parallelizing Your Application


Having identified the hotspots and having done the basic exercises to set goals and expectations, the developer needs to parallelize the code. Depending on the original code, this can be as simple as calling into an existing GPU-optimized library such as `cuBLAS`, `cuFFT`, or `Thrust`, or it could be as simple as adding a few preprocessor directives as hints to a parallelizing compiler.


On the other hand, some applications’ designs will require some amount of refactoring to expose their inherent parallelism. As even CPU architectures require exposing this parallelism in order to improve or simply maintain the performance of sequential applications, the CUDA family of parallel programming languages (CUDA C++, CUDA Fortran, etc.) aims to make the expression of this parallelism as simple as possible, while simultaneously enabling operation on CUDA-capable GPUs designed for maximum parallel throughput.
