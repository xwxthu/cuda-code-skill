# 7. Getting the Right Answer


Obtaining the right answer is clearly the principal goal of all computation. On parallel systems, it is possible to run into difficulties not typically found in traditional serial-oriented programming. These include threading issues, unexpected values due to the way floating-point values are computed, and challenges arising from differences in the way CPU and GPU processors operate. This chapter examines issues that can affect the correctness of returned data and points to appropriate solutions.


##  7.1. Verification 

###  7.1.1. Reference Comparison 

A key aspect of correctness verification for modifications to any existing program is to establish some mechanism whereby previous known-good reference outputs from representative inputs can be compared to new results. After each change is made, ensure that the results match using whatever criteria apply to the particular algorithm. Some will expect bitwise identical results, which is not always possible, especially where floating-point arithmetic is concerned; see [Numerical Accuracy and Precision](#numerical-accuracy-and-precision) regarding numerical accuracy. For other algorithms, implementations may be considered correct if they match the reference within some small epsilon.

Note that the process used for validating numerical results can easily be extended to validate performance results as well. We want to ensure that each change we make is correct _and_ that it improves performance (and by how much). Checking these things frequently as an integral part of our cyclical APOD process will help ensure that we achieve the desired results as rapidly as possible.

###  7.1.2. Unit Testing 

A useful counterpart to the reference comparisons described above is to structure the code itself in such a way that is readily verifiable at the unit level. For example, we can write our CUDA kernels as a collection of many short `__device__` functions rather than one large monolithic `__global__` function; each device function can be tested independently before hooking them all together.

For example, many kernels have complex addressing logic for accessing memory in addition to their actual computation. If we validate our addressing logic separately prior to introducing the bulk of the computation, then this will simplify any later debugging efforts. (Note that the CUDA compiler considers any device code that does not contribute to a write to global memory as dead code subject to elimination, so we must at least write _something_ out to global memory as a result of our addressing logic in order to successfully apply this strategy.)

Going a step further, if most functions are defined as `__host__ __device__` rather than just `__device__` functions, then these functions can be tested on both the CPU and the GPU, thereby increasing our confidence that the function is correct and that there will not be any unexpected differences in the results. If there _are_ differences, then those differences will be seen early and can be understood in the context of a simple function.

As a useful side effect, this strategy will allow us a means to reduce code duplication should we wish to include both CPU and GPU execution paths in our application: if the bulk of the work of our CUDA kernels is done in `__host__ __device__` functions, we can easily call those functions from both the host code _and_ the device code without duplication.


##  7.2. Debugging 

CUDA-GDB is a port of the GNU Debugger that runs on Linux and Mac; see: <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gdb>.

The NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition is available as a free plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio; see: <https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition>.

Several third-party debuggers support CUDA debugging as well; see: <https://developer.nvidia.com/debugging-solutions> for more details.


##  7.3. Numerical Accuracy and Precision 

Incorrect or unexpected results arise principally from issues of floating-point accuracy due to the way floating-point values are computed and stored. The following sections explain the principal items of interest. Other peculiarities of floating-point arithmetic are presented in Features and Technical Specifications of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide as well as in a whitepaper and accompanying webinar on floating-point precision and performance available from <https://developer.nvidia.com/content/precision-performance-floating-point-and-ieee-754-compliance-nvidia-gpus>.

###  7.3.1. Single vs. Double Precision 

Devices of [CUDA Compute Capability](#cuda-compute-capability) 1.3 and higher provide native support for double-precision floating-point values (that is, values 64 bits wide). Results obtained using double-precision arithmetic will frequently differ from the same operation performed via single-precision arithmetic due to the greater precision of the former and due to rounding issues. Therefore, it is important to be sure to compare values of like precision and to express the results within a certain tolerance rather than expecting them to be exact.

###  7.3.2. Floating Point Math Is Not Associative 

Each floating-point arithmetic operation involves a certain amount of rounding. Consequently, the order in which arithmetic operations are performed is important. If A, B, and C are floating-point values, (A+B)+C is not guaranteed to equal A+(B+C) as it is in symbolic math. When you parallelize computations, you potentially change the order of operations and therefore the parallel results might not match sequential results. This limitation is not specific to CUDA, but an inherent part of parallel computation on floating-point values.

###  7.3.3. IEEE 754 Compliance 

All CUDA compute devices follow the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point representation, with some small exceptions. These exceptions, which are detailed in Features and Technical Specifications of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide, can lead to results that differ from IEEE 754 values computed on the host system.

One of the key differences is the fused multiply-add (FMA) instruction, which combines multiply-add operations into a single instruction execution. Its result will often differ slightly from results obtained by doing the two operations separately.

###  7.3.4. x86 80-bit Computations 

x86 processors can use an 80-bit _double extended precision_ math when performing floating-point calculations. The results of these calculations can frequently differ from pure 64-bit operations performed on the CUDA device. To get a closer match between values, set the x86 host processor to use regular double or single precision (64 bits and 32 bits, respectively). This is done with the `FLDCW` x86 assembly instruction or the equivalent operating system API.
