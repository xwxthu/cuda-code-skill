# 2. Preface


This Best Practices Guide is a manual to help developers obtain the best performance from NVIDIA® CUDA® GPUs. It presents established parallelization and optimization techniques and explains coding metaphors and idioms that can greatly simplify programming for CUDA-capable GPU architectures.


While the contents can be used as a reference manual, you should be aware that some topics are revisited in different contexts as various programming and configuration topics are explored. As a result, it is recommended that first-time readers proceed through the guide sequentially. This approach will greatly improve your understanding of effective programming practices and enable you to better use the guide for reference later.


##  2.1. Who Should Read This Guide? 

The discussions in this guide all use the C++ programming language, so you should be comfortable reading C++ code.

This guide refers to and relies on several other documents that you should have at your disposal for reference, all of which are available at no cost from the CUDA website <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/>. The following documents are especially important resources:

  * CUDA Installation Guide

  * CUDA C++ Programming Guide

  * CUDA Toolkit Reference Manual


In particular, the optimization section of this guide assumes that you have already successfully downloaded and installed the CUDA Toolkit (if not, please refer to the relevant CUDA Installation Guide for your platform) and that you have a basic familiarity with the CUDA C++ programming language and environment (if not, please refer to the CUDA C++ Programming Guide).


##  2.2. Assess, Parallelize, Optimize, Deploy 

This guide introduces the _Assess, Parallelize, Optimize, Deploy(APOD)_ design cycle for applications with the goal of helping application developers to rapidly identify the portions of their code that would most readily benefit from GPU acceleration, rapidly realize that benefit, and begin leveraging the resulting speedups in production as early as possible.

APOD is a cyclical process: initial speedups can be achieved, tested, and deployed with only minimal initial investment of time, at which point the cycle can begin again by identifying further optimization opportunities, seeing additional speedups, and then deploying the even faster versions of the application into production.

###  2.2.1. Assess 

For an existing project, the first step is to assess the application to locate the parts of the code that are responsible for the bulk of the execution time. Armed with this knowledge, the developer can evaluate these bottlenecks for parallelization and start to investigate GPU acceleration.

By understanding the end-user’s requirements and constraints and by applying Amdahl’s and Gustafson’s laws, the developer can determine the upper bound of performance improvement from acceleration of the identified portions of the application.

###  2.2.2. Parallelize 

Having identified the hotspots and having done the basic exercises to set goals and expectations, the developer needs to parallelize the code. Depending on the original code, this can be as simple as calling into an existing GPU-optimized library such as `cuBLAS`, `cuFFT`, or `Thrust`, or it could be as simple as adding a few preprocessor directives as hints to a parallelizing compiler.

On the other hand, some applications’ designs will require some amount of refactoring to expose their inherent parallelism. As even CPU architectures will require exposing parallelism in order to improve or simply maintain the performance of sequential applications, the CUDA family of parallel programming languages (CUDA C++, CUDA Fortran, etc.) aims to make the expression of this parallelism as simple as possible, while simultaneously enabling operation on CUDA-capable GPUs designed for maximum parallel throughput.

###  2.2.3. Optimize 

After each round of application parallelization is complete, the developer can move to optimizing the implementation to improve performance. Since there are many possible optimizations that can be considered, having a good understanding of the needs of the application can help to make the process as smooth as possible. However, as with APOD as a whole, program optimization is an iterative process (identify an opportunity for optimization, apply and test the optimization, verify the speedup achieved, and repeat), meaning that it is not necessary for a programmer to spend large amounts of time memorizing the bulk of all possible optimization strategies prior to seeing good speedups. Instead, strategies can be applied incrementally as they are learned.

Optimizations can be applied at various levels, from overlapping data transfers with computation all the way down to fine-tuning floating-point operation sequences. The available profiling tools are invaluable for guiding this process, as they can help suggest a next-best course of action for the developer’s optimization efforts and provide references into the relevant portions of the optimization section of this guide.

###  2.2.4. Deploy 

Having completed the GPU acceleration of one or more components of the application it is possible to compare the outcome with the original expectation. Recall that the initial _assess_ step allowed the developer to determine an upper bound for the potential speedup attainable by accelerating given hotspots.

Before tackling other hotspots to improve the total speedup, the developer should consider taking the partially parallelized implementation and carry it through to production. This is important for a number of reasons; for example, it allows the user to profit from their investment as early as possible (the speedup may be partial but is still valuable), and it minimizes risk for the developer and the user by providing an evolutionary rather than revolutionary set of changes to the application.


##  2.3. Recommendations and Best Practices 

Throughout this guide, specific recommendations are made regarding the design and implementation of CUDA C++ code. These recommendations are categorized by priority, which is a blend of the effect of the recommendation and its scope. Actions that present substantial improvements for most CUDA applications have the highest priority, while small optimizations that affect only very specific situations are given a lower priority.

Before implementing lower priority recommendations, it is good practice to make sure all higher priority recommendations that are relevant have already been applied. This approach will tend to provide the best results for the time invested and will avoid the trap of premature optimization.

The criteria of benefit and scope for establishing priority will vary depending on the nature of the program. In this guide, they represent a typical case. Your code might reflect different priority factors. Regardless of this possibility, it is good practice to verify that no higher-priority recommendations have been overlooked before undertaking lower-priority items.

Note

Code samples throughout the guide omit error checking for conciseness. Production code should, however, systematically check the error code returned by each API call and check for failures in kernel launches by calling `cudaGetLastError()`.


##  2.4. Assessing Your Application 

From supercomputers to mobile phones, modern processors increasingly rely on parallelism to provide performance. The core computational unit, which includes control, arithmetic, registers and typically some cache, is replicated some number of times and connected to memory via a network. As a result, all modern processors require parallel code in order to achieve good utilization of their computational power.

While processors are evolving to expose more fine-grained parallelism to the programmer, many existing applications have evolved either as serial codes or as coarse-grained parallel codes (for example, where the data is decomposed into regions processed in parallel, with sub-regions shared using MPI). In order to profit from any modern processor architecture, GPUs included, the first steps are to assess the application to identify the hotspots, determine whether they can be parallelized, and understand the relevant workloads both now and in the future.
